#+TITLE: re-frame-and-jekyll

A simple [[https://github.com/Day8/re-frame][re-frame]] static, single-page application. It is a simple
proof of concept to show how to use re-frame to use reagent components
in markdown files served by Jekyll, the static website engine used by
GitHub pages.

=resources/public/index.html= isn't used by Jekyll, only for
standalone figwheel local development so you don't have to mess with
figwheel + jekyll.
